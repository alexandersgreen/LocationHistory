# LocationHistory
Haskell code for extracting location history from the JSON generated from Google Takeout, and for generating an image of the location history

Sample [image from Halifax, NS](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/alexandersgreen/LocationHistory/master/images/halifax1024.jpg)

This code needs to be split into multiple modules...

There is also code for creating an interactive view of the Location History using Gloss.

To create an archive for use in this program, the Location History JSON data downloaded via Google Takeout needs to be added as the only file in a new zip archive.
